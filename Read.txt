Project Name
Brief description of the project and its purpose.

Installation
Instructions on how to install and set up the project :-
To create a Node.js application using the Express framework and MongoDB database, follow these steps:

1)Install Node.js and MongoDB on your computer.
2)Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in your terminal.
3)Initialize your project by running npm init and following the prompts.
4)Install the necessary dependencies by running npm install express mongoose body-parser in your terminal.
5)Create a new file called app.js in your project directory.
6)In app.js, require the necessary modules and set up your Express app:
7)Define your routes in app.js. Here's an example of a simple route:
8)Run your app by running node app.js in your terminal. Visit http://localhost:3000/ in your browser to see the output.
To connect your backend app to your frontend app, you'll need to make API calls from your frontend app to your backend app. 
This will make a GET request to your backend app at http://localhost:3000/ and log the response to the console. 
You can use this same approach to make POST, PUT, and DELETE requests as well.




Usage
Instructions on how to use the project and its features.

Source Code
Project's source code, including its structure and any important libraries 
or frameworks used as per given guidelines for the assessment.

APIs
A list of any APIs used in the project, including their purpose and documentation links.
The API used to fetch the data in a Node.js application using the Express framework and MongoDB database
will depend on how you define your routes and data models. Here's an example of how to
create a route to fetch all the records from a MongoDB collection using Mongoose:

javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// define a schema for your data
const dataSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  age: Number
});

// create a model for your data based on the schema
const Data = mongoose.model('Data', dataSchema);

// define a route to fetch all records from the database
router.get('/data', (req, res) => {
  Data.find({}, (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
      res.status(500).send(err);
    } else {
      res.send(data);
    }
  });
});

module.exports = router;

Host Name and URL
The hostname and URL of the project's deployment, localhost(3800) is used for server and client side and localhost(3000) is used to display the results.
